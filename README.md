2D Structural Image Detection Dataset
===============

This dataset contains 2700 structural images containing damage: crack and spalling. It is labeled by [Cal Unmanned Research Lab](http://unmanned.berkeley.edu/) from University of California, Berkeley. The source of data base includes public dataset, [SDNET](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/all_datasets/48/) and [PEER Hub Image Set](https://apps.peer.berkeley.edu/phi-net/), and self-collected data.

Guidance
----------

This dataset labeled crack and spalling with 2D bounding box. [labelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg) is a good tool to visialize or edit images and labels.
